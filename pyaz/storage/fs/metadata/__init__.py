    Required Parameters:
    - metadata -- Metadata in space-separated key=value pairs. This overwrites any existing metadata.
    - name -- File system name (i.e. container name).

    Optional Parameters:
    - account_key -- Storage account key. Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_KEY
    - account_name -- Storage account name. Related environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT. Must be used in conjunction with either storage account key or a SAS token. If neither are present, the command will try to query the storage account key using the authenticated Azure account. If a large number of storage commands are executed the API quota may be hit
    - auth_mode -- The mode in which to run the command. "login" mode will directly use your login credentials for the authentication. The legacy "key" mode will attempt to query for an account key if no authentication parameters for the account are provided. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_AUTH_MODE
    - connection_string -- Storage account connection string. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
    - sas_token -- A Shared Access Signature (SAS). Must be used in conjunction with storage account name. Environment variable: AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN
    - timeout -- Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
